Important Notice:

Thank you for playing this text-based CTF. Please be advised that this game contains mature themes, including references to crime, kidnapping, and potentially distressing situations. The story is a fictional scenario created for entertainment purposes and does not reflect real-life events. While the game aims to challenge problem-solving and decision-making skills in a thrilling narrative, we encourage players to be mindful of the sensitive topics presented.

Kidnapping is very real and happens right under our noses all over the world.
This game is inspired by the work of Trace Labs, an organization that gamifies the process of helping to find real missing people using OSINT.

Thank you for your understanding, and enjoy your adventure!
